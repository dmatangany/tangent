Hi Andre

Good day.

I am doing the assignment today.

I see I have a choice of the technology to use.

Since look and feel is important, I have decided to use an ANGULAR front end.

I usually connect it to a Java(JWT) web service or .NET [webapi] web service backend.

In this case, I just connect it to your service.

I am using high charts for graphics. I can also use Microsoft BI.

Let me know if this is cool.

Many thanks.

Regards

Davison
